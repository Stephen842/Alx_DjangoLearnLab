# Introduction to Django – Development Environment Setup

Welcome to my **ALX Django LearnLab** repository!  
Mastering Django — a powerful and popular Python web framework used for building secure, scalable applications.

---

## Objective
The primary goal of this task is to:

- Install Django and set up a functional development environment.
- Create a new Django project named **LibraryProject**.
- Understand the default structure of a Django project.
- Successfully run the application using the Django development server.

This serves as the foundation for all future Django applications I’ll build throughout this learning program.

## Project Setup Steps

Ensure Python is installed on your system, then run:

```bash
pip install django
